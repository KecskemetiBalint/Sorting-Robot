## Sorting Robot

 This robot was designed based on a real airport baggage handling system. It is able to sort the input discs (baggage) based on their color to the appropriate buckets (white, black and colored). The robot is also designed in such a way to counter most possible errors, and in case an error still occures, the robust fault detection system logs the issue and guides the user to solve it. The robot was created by Bálint Kecskeméti, Stefan Birca, Botond Mecsei, Louis-Philippe Fink, Doruk Ödemis, Mihir Thakur and Iva Bondzheva as the final project for the course CBL Embedded Systems (2IO75) at TU/e.

Download the OpenCV 4.8.0 library and add it to the folder containing this project folder (NOT in the project folder).
We use WiringPi library for managing the pins. Also we use the ADC library to manage the IR sensors.
